# UFOs

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive website containing information about UFO sightings in preparation for an upcomming gathering of UFO enthusiasts in McMinnville, Oregon.
In this new website, users will be able to filter for a date, city, state, country, and shape of spotted UFOs across the Uited States and Canada.

## Results

There are over 100 entries of spotted UFOs across the U.S. and Canda. The raw data coming from a Javascript array is now being displayed in the form of a table, in which users can filter and un-filtered as desired using the tool on the left of the table:

Users can type in their criteria in the filters section, and the data will automatically display the information that matches the criteria as showned in the below screenshot:

## Summary

This websites allows users to quickly look information of sppottedd UFOs based on certain criteria. However, one drawback of this design is that the filters do not have a drop-down menu. Adding a drop-down menu so users know what information is contained in the table would be one recommendation for future development. Additionally, I would prefer the table to display the first 20 rows, and add a "Next Page" buttom. By doing this, the web-page would not be as long when it is not filtered.

One last recommendation for future develpment wouldl be to capitalize the first letter of city, state, and country names to make it look cleaner and more appealing to the eye.
